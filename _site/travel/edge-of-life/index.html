<p>George Santayana on travel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need sometimes to escape into open solitudes, into aimlessness, into the moral holiday of running some pure hazard in order to sharpen the edge of life, to taste hardship, and to be compelled to work desperately for a moment at no matter what.</p>
</blockquote>
