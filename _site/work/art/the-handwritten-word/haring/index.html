<p>Artist and social activist Keith Haring is best known for his 1980s pop-art that began with chalk drawings in the subways of New York City. By the end of the decade he was internationally renown for his work.</p>

<p>The quote above was written circa-1987 in a note to a fan and aspiring artist. The full letter can be found here.</p>

<p>The quote, as I have presented it, is intended for large format printing. I have sought to perserve the handwriting characteristics while offering a clean presentation beyond simple enlargement. At near full resolution, the image appears like the capture below.</p>
