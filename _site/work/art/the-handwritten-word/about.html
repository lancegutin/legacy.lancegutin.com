<p>The handwritten word is dying. Some argue, the pervasiveness of technology will inevitably kill the need to write anything by hand. Time will tell. However, it is clear, as a culture we write less than we once did.</p>

<p>I think that’s a shame.</p>

<p>Unlike print, handwritten text transcends the words it uses. It’s personal and unique and it changes. It’s human. Graphologists will tell you a sample of handwriting can reveal a ton about the writer’s circumstance and personality. 
Visually, it can also be simply fascinating to inspect.</p>

<p>That said, I see value in exploring the handwritten word as art.</p>

<p>Initially, I have focused on gathering handwritten, inspirational quotes from well-known or historical figures. Much of my search has occurred on <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/">Letters of Note</a>, a fantastic blog of letters, postcards, telegrams, faxes, and memos.</p>

<p>My current approach is to enlarge and graphically simplify a selection of handwritten quotes into large-format prints.</p>
