Artist and social activist Keith Haring is best known for his 1980s pop-art that began with chalk drawings in the subways of New York City. By the end of the decade he was internationally renown for his work. 

The quote above was written circa-1987 in a note to a fan and aspiring artist. The full letter can be found here.

The quote, as I have presented it, is intended for large format printing. I have sought to perserve the handwriting characteristics while offering a clean presentation beyond simple enlargement. At near full resolution, the image appears like the capture below.
