On November 23rd, 2015, I boarded a plane and embarked on a year of travel. I quit my job, ended my lease, and said goodbye to my family and friends. It was the most difficult decision I ever made and it took years to realize. 

It also came with a lot of doubt and uncertainty. Why do this? 

For me, travel represents the ultimate learning opportunity. A chance to broaden my understanding of the world and of myself; a density and diversity of life experience that is difficult to achieve otherwise. 

By traveling slowly, cheaply, and independently, I hope to magnify my journey. I hope to discover what is essential and appreciate what I have by doing without. I hope to challenge myself and do the things that terrify me. I hope to see things and meet people that will change me forever. 

Ultimately, we all craft a life story. I chose to travel for a year to ensure I'd have a story worth telling.
